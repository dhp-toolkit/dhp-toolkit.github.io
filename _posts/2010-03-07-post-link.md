## Module Overview

This hands-on module introduces GitHub as a powerful collaborative platform for publishing historical work online. Students will learn how to:
* Set up a GitHub repository
* Write and organize content using Markdown
* Use Git and GitHub to track changes and collaborate
* Publish a website with GitHub Pages

## 1. What is GitHub and Why Use It for History Projects?

GitHub is a version control and collaboration platform widely used in software development, but its tools are highly applicable to historical research and teaching. For digital history projects—especially ones involving collaborative transcription, annotation, and public presentation—GitHub offers structured, transparent, and sustainable workflows that align with the best practices of both scholarly rigor and public engagement.

### 1. Versioning and Reproducibility of Transcriptions and Edits
GitHub tracks every change made to a file, preserving a complete history of revisions. This benefits historians by:
* Ensuring transparency in transcription work, showing how a document was interpreted and revised over time
* Allowing rollbacks to earlier versions in case of errors or unintended edits
* Supporting collaborative accountability by recording who made each change


Example: A student revises tagging conventions for place names in an 1892 treaty. GitHub logs the update with a message like "Refined TEI tags for Ras al-Khaimah references."

### 2. Structured, Collaborative Annotation

GitHub enables multiple contributors to annotate, comment, and suggest edits through a clear and reviewable workflow:
* Issues can be used to flag uncertainties, pose historical questions, or suggest corrections
* Pull requests allow students to propose changes and get peer/instructor feedback
* Branching supports parallel work without conflicts


Example: One student flags a clause in a treaty as ambiguous. Another proposes updated tags and historical context via a pull request, which is reviewed before merging.

### 3. Publishing Sources and Interpretation Together

GitHub Pages allows historians to build and publish clean, static websites directly from their repositories:
* Combine primary sources (e.g., treaty scans and transcriptions) with historical analysis (student blog posts or contextual essays)
* Embed interactive maps, timelines, and text visualizations
* Update and maintain content without relying on commercial platforms

Example: A student site displays scans of the Trucial Chief agreements alongside searchable transcriptions and a Voyant word cloud showing shifts in treaty language.

### 4. Teaching and Documenting Historical Research Methods

GitHub supports reproducible, documented research practices—key for pedagogy and future reuse:
* Students can contribute to shared guides on using Transkribus, ArcGIS, or Voyant
* Markdown files can document reflection, methodology, or data cleaning steps
* Templates or starter kits help future students onboard quickly

Example: The repository includes /docs/transkribus-guide.md with screenshots and steps created by past students, reducing onboarding time for new cohorts.

### 5. Sustaining Collaborative Digital Archives

Long-term, GitHub allows you to build a living digital archive:
* Organize treaty texts, transcriptions, and annotations by region or date
* Track student contributions across years
* Store structured data formats (e.g., TEI XML, GeoJSON) for future analysis
* Enable public access while maintaining academic integrity

Example: Over multiple semesters, the project grows into a repository of annotated Gulf treaties, searchable by location, topic, or year, and reusable by other scholars.

## 2. Key Tools and Terms

Repository (repo) - A project folder on GitHub containing files and history
Markdown - A lightweight markup language for formatting text (.md files)
Commit - A saved change, with a message describing what was done
Branch - A parallel version of the repo, useful for editing safely
GitHub Pages - A feature to host static websites from a GitHub repo

## 3. Setup Instructions (One-Time)
A. Create a GitHub Account:
 Visit github.com and sign up.
B. Install Git (for local work):
 Download Git for your OS.
C. Install VS Code (optional, for editing Markdown locally):
 Download here

## 4. Create Your First Repository
* Go to GitHub > + icon > "New repository"
* Name it your-username.github.io (for GitHub Pages)
* Choose: Public, add README, no .gitignore or license yet
* Click "Create repository"


## 5. Writing Content in Markdown

Create files like ```index.md, about.md, transcriptions/page01.md```

Sample Markdown Syntax:


```ruby
# Title of the Document

## Subtitle

This is a **bold** statement.  
This is *italicized*.  
This is a [link](https://qdl.qa/).  

### Blockquote
> Treaties were signed under British supervision.

### Code Block

```
