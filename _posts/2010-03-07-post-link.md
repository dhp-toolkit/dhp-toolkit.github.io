# GitHub for Historians: Building and Publishing with GitHub Pages

## Module Overview

This hands-on module introduces GitHub as a powerful collaborative platform for publishing historical work online. Students will learn how to:
* Set up a GitHub repository
* Write and organize content using Markdown
* Use Git and GitHub to track changes and collaborate
* Publish a website with GitHub Pages

## 1. What is GitHub and Why Use It for History Projects?

GitHub is a version control and collaboration platform widely used in software development, but its tools are highly applicable to historical research and teaching. For digital history projects—especially ones involving collaborative transcription, annotation, and public presentation—GitHub offers structured, transparent, and sustainable workflows that align with the best practices of both scholarly rigor and public engagement.

### Versioning and Reproducibility of Transcriptions and Edits
GitHub tracks every change made to a file, preserving a complete history of revisions. This benefits historians by:
* Ensuring transparency in transcription work, showing how a document was interpreted and revised over time
* Allowing rollbacks to earlier versions in case of errors or unintended edits
* Supporting collaborative accountability by recording who made each change
Example: A student revises tagging conventions for place names in an 1892 treaty. GitHub logs the update with a message like "Refined TEI tags for Ras al-Khaimah references."



```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
