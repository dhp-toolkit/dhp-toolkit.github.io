## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of how to work with Jupyter Notebook. We strongly recommend that you take the `Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook` tutorial before taking this tutorial.

**Before you begin:**

You can follow this tutorial in one of two ways:

- Download and run the notebook directly on your computer using Jupyter (e.g., through Anaconda or any Python environment that supports notebooks), or
- Create a new Jupyter notebook and copy-paste the code and explanations step-by-step as you follow along. This lets you write and test your own code interactively.

Choose whichever method youâ€™re most comfortable with â€” both will work just fine!

The ready-to-run Jupyter notebook can be downloaded following this [link](https://github.com/dhp-toolkit/dhp-toolkit.github.io/blob/master/assets/notebooks/QueryingGeoNames.ipynb){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

> To download the file following the above link, click on 3 dots on the upper-right corner which displays 'More file actions', then click on the Download button.

## 1. Introduction

**"Gazetteers"** are structured lists of place names with information about their locations, variants, and historical context. In this tutorial, we will create a small dataset of historical places from the **Trucial Coast** (pre-UAE region) and enrich it using the **GeoNames API**.

## 2. Objective
We will:
- Start from a **CSV** file containing a few historical town names
- Use the **GeoNames API** to retrieve coordinates and metadata
- Save the enriched dataset to a new **CSV** file


## 3. Setup: Install Required Libraries

The libraries you need to install are for this tutorial are:

- **`pandas`**: helps us easily create, manage, and manipulate structured datasets like our gazetteer of historical places
- **`requests`**: allows us to send HTTP requests to the GeoNames API, so we can enrich our dataset with location adetails and additional information from this online geographic database

> **Note:** These libraries might already be installed in your environment. In that case, running the command will display a message similar to:`Requirement already satisfied`

You can install those libraries by running the following code:
```!pip install pandas requests```

## 4. Load the Input CSV

You can download the sample input file used for this tutorial using this [link](https://github.com/dhp-toolkit/dhp-toolkit.github.io/blob/master/assets/trucial_towns.zip){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

If you choose to use your own input file with this tutorial, be sure to replace the file name in the code (`trucial_towns.csv`) with the name of your own file and ensure your file contains at least the following column:
- `name`: historical place name

Aditional columns (optional but recommended):
- `type`: A description of the kind of place â€” e.g., fort, settlement, port, etc.
- `source`: A note about where the name came from â€” e.g., a historical map, archive, or article

Columns `source` and `type` wonâ€™t be used in the GeoNames query itself, but they are useful for organizing, filtering, or analyzing your results later.

**Example row:**

```ruby
Ras Al Khaimah,	port, Lorimer Gazetteer
```
> ðŸ“Œ Note: In this tutorial, you do not need to provide a country code to make a query. The GeoNames API will search globally using only the place name.


**Loading the CSV:**

Make sure to save `trucial_towns.csv` in the same folder as this notebook file (`.ipynb`) so it can be loaded correctly.

```rubys
import pandas as pd

# Load input CSV
input_file = "trucial_towns.csv"  # Rename this if to match your file name and make sure it is in the same folder as your notebook
df = pd.read_csv(input_file)

# Display the data
df.head()
```

After you run the above code, you will see the following dataframe printed:
![Output](/assets/images/geonames/tutorial-geonames-4.1.png)


## 5. Define the GeoNames Query Function

We will use the free **GeoNames API** to retrieve information for each town. You must register at [https://www.geonames.org/login](https://www.geonames.org/login){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and get a username.

`query_geonames` used below is a function that sends a request to the GeoNames API using the place name. It returns information like latitude, longitude, and geographic classification for the most relevant result found.

**Code:**

```ruby
import requests # This library allows us to send HTTP requests (to talk to web APIs)
import time # This library lets us pause between API calls, to avoid rate limits

GEONAMES_USERNAME = "GeoNames_username"  # CHANGE THIS to your registered GeoNames username

def query_geonames(place_name):
    base_url = "http://api.geonames.org/searchJSON" # The GeoNames API endpoint
    params = {
        'q': place_name, # The place name you want to search for (e.g., "Sharjah")
        'maxRows': 1,    # Only return the top 1 result (most relevant match)
        'username': GEONAMES_USERNAME
    }
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params) # Send GET request to GeoNames
    
    # Print the request info for debugging. This helps you verify whether the request worked.
    print(f"Querying: {place_name}")
    print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}") 
    if response.status_code == 200: # A status code of 200 means success.
        results = response.json()   # Convert the API response to a Python dictionary
        print(f"Response JSON: {results}") # This will show the full API response
        
        geonames_data = results.get('geonames', [])  # Get the list of results
        if geonames_data:
            top = geonames_data[0]  # Take the first (best match)
            return top.get('lat'), top.get('lng'), top.get('geonameId'), top.get('fcl'), top.get('fcode')
    return '', '', '', '', ''
```


## 6. Enrich the Dataset

For each row in our dataset, we take the name of the place and use the `query_geonames()` function to retrieve data from GeoNames. The results are added as new columns to the dataset.

We also include a one-second pause between requests (`time.sleep(1)`) to avoid hitting the API's rate limits.

**Code:**

```ruby
# Add empty columns for enriched data
df['latitude'] = ''
df['longitude'] = ''
df['geonames_id'] = ''
df['feature_class'] = ''
df['feature_code'] = ''

# Query each place
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    lat, lon, gid, fcl, fcode = query_geonames(row['name']) # Call the query_geonames function for each row listed in the dataframe
    df.at[idx, 'latitude'] = lat
    df.at[idx, 'longitude'] = lon
    df.at[idx, 'geonames_id'] = gid
    df.at[idx, 'feature_class'] = fcl
    df.at[idx, 'feature_code'] = fcode
    time.sleep(1)  # Pause to avoid rate limits

# Show enriched data
df.head() # displays the first 5 rows
```

**Expected output:**

Full API Response:
![API Response](/assets/images/geonames/tutorial-geonames-6.1.png)

Final dataframe:
![API Response](/assets/images/geonames/tutorial-geonames-6.2.png)

## 7. Save the Result into a CSV file

**Code:**

```ruby
output_file = "trucial_towns_enriched.csv"
df.to_csv(output_file, index=False) # Save the output as a csv file
print(f"Saved enriched dataset to {output_file}")
```
**Expected output:**

## 8. What's Next?

Now that you have coordinates and metadata, you can:
- Import into **QGIS** or **Google My Maps** for visualization
- Align with the **World Historical Gazetteer (WHG)**
- Add temporal information and submit your dataset to WHG for educational use

You can also extend this notebook to:
- Query for multiple alternate names
- Visualize the towns using **Python libraries** like `folium` or `plotly`
- Compare coverage with **Wikidata** or **WHG**
