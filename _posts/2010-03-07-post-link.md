**Need help along the way? Use ChatGPT or any other Generative AI!**

If you get stuck, don’t worry—many issues are easy to fix. Try asking ChatGPT for help. Just copy-paste the error message you see on GitHub (or take a screenshot of what you’re seeing), and ask something like:

*“I’m following a tutorial to publish a site using GitHub Pages, and I’m getting this error. How can I fix it?”*

You can also ask general questions like:

*“What does this file do?” or “How do I find my Markdown files?”*

## 1. Why GitHub for Historians?

GitHub is more than a programmers’ playground: it’s a free, version‑controlled, and openly accessible platform for storing any text‑based project. For historians, that means:
Keeping a transparent record of revisions to research notes, teaching materials, or digital exhibits.
Collaborating smoothly with co‑authors or students.
Publishing a professional website at your‑username.github.io with minimal setup.

## 3.  Setting up GitHub Account, GitHub Desktop  & Visual Studio Code

### Step 1. Sign Up for GitHub
1. Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/) → Sign up.
2. Choose a username (this will be visible in your site URL later).
3. Verify your email & complete the short survey.

### Step 2. Download GitHub Desktop
1. Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/) and download for your OS.
2. Install and sign in with the account you just created.

### Step 3. Download MS Visual Studio Code
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download it for your OS via the .zip method. The .zip install is good for beginners, while advanced users can use other installation methods like the command line.
2. Open the downloaded zip file and follow the instructions.

## 4. Set Up Your Website Repository from a Template

**What is a repository?** A repository (or repo) is a container or folder for your project. It holds all the files, images, and code your site needs.

**How is a website linked to a repository?** GitHub Pages automatically turns the contents of a repository named your-username.github.io into a live website at that exact URL. The name must match your GitHub username exactly.

GitHub allows one website repository per user at the your-username.github.io address. You can still make unlimited project sites under different names, but for your homepage, only one repo can be tied to that web address.

**What to do if I already have a repository named your-username.github.io?** If you already have a repository named your-username.github.io that has a corresponding website published via GitHub Pages, what you can do is:

**Option 1: Delete the Existing Repository**
* If you want to start fresh, you can delete the current repository and create a new one using a different template.
* Follow the deletion instructions in this tutorial.
* Once deleted, GitHub will release the web address, and you can reuse ```your-username.github.io```.

**Option 2: Create a Project Site Instead**
* You can only have one personal site at ```your-username.github.io```, but you can still create multiple project sites.
* Just name the new repository anything else (e.g., digital-archive-project) and enable GitHub Pages from its settings.
* Your project site will be published at: ```https://your-username.github.io/digital-archive-project/```

### Step 1. Choose a Template Repository
1. In a browser, open the template repository you want to use. For example, one of the templates you can use is the  Academic Pages template available at https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io .
2. Confirm it displays a green Use this template button (templates are specially flagged by their authors).

## 5. Writing Content in Markdown

Create files like ```index.md, about.md, transcriptions/page01.md```

Sample Markdown Syntax:


```ruby
# Title of the Document

## Subtitle

This is a **bold** statement.  
This is *italicized*.  
This is a [link](https://qdl.qa/).  

### Blockquote
> Treaties were signed under British supervision.

### Code Block

```
